# Yuan

Yuan is a 100% community-driven project, no pre-mine, no VC, all governances are fully on-chain. 

Yuan is an elastic token tracking the exchange rate of Chinese Yuan against USD. Unlike other elastic tokens, which purely rely on money expansion/contraction driven by deterministic algorithm, Yuan plans to develop or co-develop other protocols (i.e AMM, lending etc), so to inject more demand side variables into the equation.
